\section{Introduction and Motivation}

Much effort has gone towards methods to teach programming as an
overall concept, with systems like Alice, Scratch, and CodeSpells
demonstrating how visual programming can successfully introduce
students to this field. Our goal is to teach the more specific topic
of object-oriented programming to novice programmers using these same
techniques, focusing on how to abstract and represent ideas such as
method definitions, subclassing, and overriding in such a framework.
Additionally, to reinforce these concepts to an audience already
somewhat familiar with programming, we will introduce concreteness
fading to the system, transitioning students from visual programming
to directly writing code. This will facilitate the learning of these
specific higher-level concepts and abstractions within computer
science, which is important to effectively educate and train the next
generation of computer science and software development students.

\section{Related Work}

The idea of visual programming manipulating robots or other objects in
a virtual world is not a new one; we list several games and projects
in the same vein, with some comparison to our project.

\begin{itemize}
\item CodeSpells\footnoteref{https://codespells.org/}
\item Scratch\footnoteref{https://scratch.mit.edu/}/Alice\footnoteref{http://www.alice.org/}
\item Looking Glass\footnoteref{https://lookingglass.wustl.edu/}
\item Hour of Code\footnoteref{https://code.org/learn}
\item LightBot\footnoteref{https://lightbot.com/hocflash.html}
\item Human Resource Machine\footnoteref{https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine}
\item Blockly Games\footnoteref{https://blockly-games.appspot.com/}
\item BlockPy\footnoteref{https://github.com/RealTimeWeb/blockpy}
\end{itemize}

CodeSpells, Alice, Scratch, and Looking Glass are more free-form;
instead of specific puzzles or levels to solve, they simply place the
player in a sandbox. Looking Glass tries to come up with metaphors for
object-oriented concepts, and manages to cover more of them than our
project does, but does not employ concreteness fading. Hour of Code,
LightBot, and Human Resource Machine take the same puzzle-oriented
approach our game does, but also lack the concreteness fading
aspect. Blockly Games is the most similar to our approach, initially
using blocks whose labels transition from text descriptions to code,
then changing to a text editor at the end. However, it does not
present a consistent game, changing the theme and mechanics of the
game every few levels. BlockPy is more advanced, enabling the player
to seamlessly switch between code and visual programming (and
translating one to the other), but does not use concreteness fading
either.

\section{Methodology}

\tmts{} is a purely client-side, web-based game built on
HTML5/JavaScript using Python as its instructional language. The core
concept is manipulating robots in a game world via visual or
text-based programming in order to solve puzzles and accomplish
certain objectives.

\subsection{Concepts}

\subsubsection{Learning Goals}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{progression}
  \caption{Concept Progression}
\label{fig:progression}
\end{figure}

When setting out to teach a concept as broad as object-oriented
programming, we needed to be careful not to overshoot a practical
scope. As such, to limit game length and complexity, we selected a few
basic concepts building up to inheritance. This means that advanced topics
such as abstract classes and polymorphism are not covered. This is an
acceptable trade-off because the purpose of this game is not to teach
OOP in its entirety, but rather to ease the conceptual transition for
new programmers.

\autoref{fig:progression} lists the progression of requisite skills up
to mastery of inheritance (our overall learning objective). Mastering
a skill in any given level in the diagram should require mastering
every skill in the previous level. For instance, using inheritance
effectively requires that the user is writing methods across several
classes in the hierarchy, then instantiating different types of objects
with those classes. These individual skills can then be further subdivided
down to the basics of using our click-and-drag block input system.


\subsubsection{Concept Progression}

Key to helping players master concepts is the order and pace at which
they are presented. Thus, we spent quite a bit of time trying to build
up a level progression which slowly moves concept by concept through the
skill tree in \autoref{fig:progression}. The basic premise is that there
should only be about 1 new concept per level. Anything more and users are
likely to get confused. One of the predominant ways this manifests in our
game play is the introduction of new robots. Different robots introduce
ideas related to inheritance. At first this is as simple as identifying
that MineRobot (and other subclasses) can use functions for moving and
turning from the basic Robot class. However, there are more complex
applications later on, such as the way that FrackingRobot overrides a
function from MineRobot. Moreover, as new concepts are introduced, old
concepts are recombined to make new puzzles. For example, the HeavyLifter
is used in a context such that it needs to use a function defined in the
basic Robot class. However, it also requires implementing that method first.

\subsubsection{Concreteness Fading}

Of course, the progression of actual concepts works in tandem with the
gradual concreteness fading of the actual blocks that the user is
working with. A key issue here, which we identified in user tests during
the beta phase, is that changes to the blocks should not happen while
another concept is introduced because players get overwhelmed by the
number of new skills required.

Thus, in addition to the care we take to introduce one concept at a
time via our level progression, we also have some levels wherein we
introduce no new object-oriented concepts. Instead, we pose a simpler
puzzle focusing on usage of the newly faded block.

Our fading process has 3 stages. Initially, all blocks start off as
textual descriptions of what they do, e.g.\ ``tell \_ to \_'' for
method invocation or ``create a new \_ called \_'' for object
instantiation (see \autoref{fig:block-unfaded}). As the player
progresses, the labels on the blocks are faded into actual Python code,
as in \autoref{fig:block-faded}. Eventually, the player will be given
a text editor and asked to write the Python code themselves. Some
scaffolding always remains; for instance, the object hierarchy view always
remains accessible after it is introduced, and serves as a reference for
what classes and methods are available.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Application Design}

\subsubsection{Simplicity}

A key factor motivating our design was a constant process of
simplification. Every time we tested after a development cycle, we would
find small components that greatly confused some users. For example,
at first for loops had a corresponding number block that needed to be
placed in the loop. This was rather tedious, so we changed it to a basic
text input box instead.

We also decided not to provide more complicated control flow, such as
boolean logic and other types of loops. In fact, even the tell blocks
are greatly simplified. Notice that no functions take parameters or
return values. This is an intentional choice, discussed in the following
section.

\subsubsection{Restrictions}

The simplifications mentioned above are an important part of not only
how we shaped user experience, but also in how we presented
puzzles. As mentioned in section 3.1.1, our goal was to focus more on
a basic set of OOP concepts and the corresponding syntax. Thus we
limited access to features that would increase the complexity of
solution code. Instead, solutions are reliant on understanding key OOP
concepts.

The memory limit in each level is another example of this
restriction. Similar to the way LightBot forces players to define
functions due to lack of space, we also create a situation such that
there is no way to finish a level under the memory limit without
defining a method. This is key to our game because it forces players
to consider the class hierarchy, and actually implement methods they
can call on objects. Without this restriction, the hierarchy (and thus
our goal of teaching OOP) could potentially be wholly disregarded.

\subsubsection{Modularity}

Our game's back end also deserves mention here, because its modularity is
extremely useful in developing the game as an educational tool. The process for
creating a level is extremely generalized, so the existing framework can
be used to easily add, remove, and reorder levels testing new concepts.
In short, it can easily be reconfigured to test more or fewer concepts than
it currently does based on the situation.

\subsection{Evaluation}

We evaluated the performance of the game by administering a pre-test
and post-test to all people who completed the game.

\subsubsection{Audience}

We targeted students who are currently enrolled in or have taken only
an introductory programming course. The game was advertised in CS 1110
(Spring 2016) at Cornell, and at Sparta High School, as well as
to specific students who have taken CS 1110 here.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Pre- and Post-Test}

The Pre- and Post-Tests that we gave were identical, 5 question quizzes
testing both object-oriented python syntax and general concepts. The goal
was to present questions that test for both practical and more abstract
understanding. The quizzes were strongly integrated into the game itself,
presented as an ``Robot Commander Aptitude Test'' and a ``Robot Commander
Proficiency Test''.
