This is what the sample does:

- Loads `MyRobot.class` from `/tmp`.
- Calls methods on it.

To achieve this:

- `class MyRobot` needs to implement `ReloadableRobot`. You will need
  the `-cp` flag to `javac` so that the compiler knows where to find
  this.
- Everything needs to be public, so it can be called.
