      <h2> What Do I Do? </h2>

      <p>Welcome, Commander. In this game, you're one of an elite team sent to colonize Mars—but something's gone wrong. Trapped inside one of the auxiliary facilities on the base, your only hope is to command the fleet of advanced robots, repair the base, and discover what happened.</p>

      <p>Mission Control is always by your side. At the start of each level, they'll let you know what needs to be done. You can always see your objectives under the map on the left. Write your code in the editor on the right—assembling blocks or writing Python—then run it using the button on the bottom left. Mission Control will monitor your progress and show you what you've accomplished.</p>

      <h2> Block Types </h2>

      <h3 id="tell">The Tell Block</h3>
      <p>The tell block gives a command to an object. The command is one of the object's methods, or a method from one of the superclasses of the object's class. That is, an object knows how to do anything from its class, and it knows how to do anything from a class that is a parent of its class.</p>

      <h3 id="object">The Object Block</h3>
      <p>An object is something that our computer systems can interact with. Each object is based on a template called a <em>class</em>. This template controls what each object knows how to do. You can issue commands to it via the <a href="#tell">tell block</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="method">The Method Block</h3>
      <p>Each object knows how to do certain things. The method block represents something an object of a particular class can do. Use the <a href="#tell">tell block</a> to issue the command to the object.</p>
