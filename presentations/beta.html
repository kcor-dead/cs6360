# The Biggest Problem

- Need better level design to convey OOP concepts
- Not really accomplished: poor level design
- Concept progression developed and implemented
- Solution: more levels, revisit how best to motivate and teach concepts

---

# UI Improvements

# TODO

- Motivating, interesting level design
- Further UI refinements
- Write and integrate the pre-test and post-test
- Integrate logging

---

# In-Class Feedback

- Understand:
    - how to use the blocks
    - concreteness fading
    - biased because of background knowledge?
- Like:
    - Basic gameplay premise
    - ...but not the levels
- Learn:
    - Not much; we all know OOP!

---

# Test Subjects

- 2 took CS 1110 but not CS 2110
    - Target audience!
- 2 in CS 2110
- 1 took all CS core classes
- 1 in MATLAB

---

# What They Understood

- Block usage, concreteness fading easy to understand
    - "That makes sense!"
    - "(laughs) Oh! Of course that didn't work."
    - "Oh baby! You're changing it to Python."
- Click-and-drag map movement very natural
- Transition to code editor understood by users that took 1110

---

# What They Liked

- Blockly's click sound (50% of testers)
- Premise, basic gameplay well recieved
    - No levels to back it up!
    - Agrees with in-class feedback

---

# What They Learned

- This is the elephant in the room
- No (interesting) levels = no learning
- Key difference:
    - Level *has* concept = no learning
    - Level *motivates* concept = learning

---

# Out-of-Class Feedback

Person A: CS 1110, 2800

- Understand: understood the "tell" block, the connection between the
  code and the map and the fading to the tell block. Was not able to
  find the class hierarchy.
- Like: thought it was an interesting project and wanted to see the
  final version when it is ready.
- Learn: no, because not enough levels were written to teach concepts
  beyond the "call method on object" paradigm that CS 1110 already
  uses.

---

# Out-of-Class Feedback

Person B: non-CS major, took CS 1110 a few semesters ago

- Understand:
    - Relatively no trouble using tell block, finding class methods, using repeat block.
    - Took a while to notice the class hierarchy features
    - Thrown off a little by fading.

- Like:
    Interested in playing more, but with a better progression and learning curve

- Learn: No, had forgotten much of 1110 and the game did not successfully
  reteach syntax

---

# Out-of-Class Feedback

Person C: CS major, taken all core classes

- Similar to in-class feedback. (include this slide or not?)
- Specific suggestions:
    - highlight new things when introduced (blocks and methods)
    - visual distinction between editing environments (main vs. method), such as background color
