# Unnamed Game

---

# Purpose

- Teach __object oriented programming__ to new programmers
- Use __concreteness fading__ to make sure concepts transfer
- Make a fun game

---

# What The Prototype Did

- Code editing via Scratch-style interface
- Code execution via Skulpt (Python)
- Top-down 2D world to control
- Objectives and hints

---

# Problem 1: No OOP Concepts

- Obviously kind of a big problem
- We didn't have time for level design
- Solution: design levels
    - Multiple objects & classes
    - Custom methods
    - Class hierarchy view
    - More typechecking in the interface, using OOP terminology

---

# Problem 2: Cluttered Interface

- Feedback: map is hard to read, tooltips clutter the interface
- Game needs to be easy to play and get into
    - Eliminate any barriers we can
- Solution: streamline and contextualize
    - Don't show info until it's needed
    - Make sure everything is large and readable
